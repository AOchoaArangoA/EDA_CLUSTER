# Exploratory Data Analysis and Clustering model

This repository contains the development of a data exploration process and the application of an unsupervised clustering model. Information from different users on financial topics is used. The main objective is to separate the data obtained by groups. Due to the presence of many atypical data, the modeling presented a considerable decrease of observations. The main idea is to know how to handle the outliers and obtain relevant information from them.
